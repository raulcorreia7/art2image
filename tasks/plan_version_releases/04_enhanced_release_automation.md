# 04 Enhanced Release Automation

## Intent
Implement comprehensive release automation with rich metadata, validation, and promotion capabilities.

## Scope
**Files to modify:**
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Enhance existing release workflow
- `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` - Release notes generation script

**Files to create:**
- `.github/workflows/validate-release.yml` - Post-release validation workflow
- `scripts/validate-release.sh` - Release validation script

**Out of scope:**
- Version synchronization (covered in task 01)
- Version bumping (covered in task 02)
- CHANGELOG management (covered in task 03)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced release notes with auto-generated content
- [ ] Binary checksums and verification information
- [ ] Platform-specific installation instructions
- [ ] Post-release validation workflow
- [ ] Support for pre-release/beta releases
- [ ] Release promotion capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive release metadata

## Plan
1. **Enhance release notes generation**
   - Auto-generated changelog section
   - Build matrix summary with platforms/architectures
   - Binary checksums (SHA256) for verification
   - Installation instructions per platform
   - Known issues and migration notes
   - Links to documentation and issues

2. **Create release notes script**
   - Generate comprehensive release notes
   - Include build artifacts information
   - Add verification instructions
   - Format for GitHub release API

3. **Add post-release validation workflow**
   - Trigger on release publication
   - Download and test release artifacts
   - Verify binary integrity with checksums
   - Test installation instructions
   - Validate documentation links
   - Report validation status

4. **Implement release promotion**
   - Support for pre-release tagging
   - Automatic promotion criteria
   - Manual approval gates for stable releases
   - Rollback capabilities for failed releases

5. **Enhance build workflow**
   - Add binary checksum generation
   - Collect build metadata
   - Generate verification reports
   - Improve error reporting

## Tests
- **Notes generation**: Produces comprehensive release notes
- **Checksum validation**: Generated checksums match binaries
- **Installation test**: Instructions work for all platforms
- **Validation workflow**: Catches release issues
- **Promotion test**: Pre-release to stable promotion works

## Risks & Rollback
**Risks:**
- Release notes generation failures
- Validation workflow false positives
- Promotion logic errors
- Checksum mismatches
- Broken installation instructions

**Rollback:**
- Manual release note creation
- Disable validation workflow
- Revert to basic release process
- Manual promotion handling

## Evidence
- Release notes include all required sections
- Checksums validate correctly
- Installation instructions tested successfully
- Validation workflow passes for releases
- Promotion process works as expected
