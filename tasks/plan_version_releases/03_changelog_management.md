# 03 CHANGELOG Management

## Intent
Implement automated changelog generation and maintenance using conventional commits for comprehensive release documentation.

## Scope
**Files to create:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Standardized changelog format
- `scripts/generate-changelog.sh` - Changelog generation script

**Files to modify:**
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Integrate changelog generation
- `Makefile` - Add changelog targets

**Out of scope:**
- Version synchronization (covered in task 01)
- Version bumping (covered in task 02)
- Release workflow enhancements (covered in task 04)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md with Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] Automated changelog generation from git commits
- [ ] Conventional commit categorization
- [ ] Integration with release workflow
- [ ] Makefile targets for changelog management
- [ ] Validation of changelog completeness

## Plan
1. **Initialize CHANGELOG.md**
   - Use Keep a Changelog format
   - Add sections: Unreleased, Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   - Include version links and comparison URLs

2. **Create changelog generation script**
   - Parse git commits since last tag
   - Categorize by conventional commit types:
     - `feat:` → Added
     - `fix:` → Fixed
     - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Changed (with breaking notice)
     - `perf:` → Changed (performance)
     - `refactor:` → Changed (internal)
   - Generate markdown sections
   - Update CHANGELOG.md in place

3. **Add Makefile changelog targets**
   ```makefile
   changelog:     # Generate changelog from commits
   changelog-check:  # Validate changelog completeness
   ```

4. **Integrate with release workflow**
   - Generate changelog before release creation
   - Include changelog in release notes
   - Commit updated changelog with version bump

5. **Add changelog validation**
   - Ensure all releases have changelog entries
   - Check for proper formatting
   - Validate version links

## Tests
- **Generation test**: Script produces correct changelog format
- **Categorization test**: Commits sorted into correct sections
- **Integration test**: Workflow includes changelog in releases
- **Validation test**: Detects missing or malformed entries
- **Link test**: Version links are valid

## Risks & Rollback
**Risks:**
- Inaccurate commit categorization
- Missing commits in changelog
- Malformed markdown breaking release notes
- Overwriting manual changelog edits

**Rollback:**
- Restore CHANGELOG.md from git
- Manual changelog correction
- Disable automated generation
- Use manual changelog maintenance

## Evidence
- CHANGELOG.md follows standard format
- Script accurately categorizes commits
- Release notes include generated changelog
- All validation checks pass
- Manual edits preserved when appropriate
